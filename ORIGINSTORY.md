# Burdock

## Rationale
I remember excitedly trying a can of Dandelion and Burdock when I was a kid.
I've never had it since, because it tasted terrible, but the words go together, and since I'm copying Dandelion it made some kind of punny sense.

## Regrets
I think it would be a better name for a companion app rather than a direct replacement, but what's done is done.
